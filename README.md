Small ATM theft script made in LUA.
This project is in 1.0 so I may encounter some bugs regarding the server side, as I haven't tested it very well yet, but in the next few weeks I will improve it.
You will be able to configure some things in config.lua, this script was made for QBOX and using OX, later on I will make more changes to support other frameworks.
To carry out the robbery you will only need a Laptop, and the rest will depend on your hacking skills in the game.
If you have problems, please let me know or create an issue.

Later on I will make another version that will use C4 to explode the ATM.
